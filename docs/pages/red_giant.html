            Image result for red giant
            A red giant forms after a star has run out of hydrogen fuel for nuclear fusion, 
            and has begun the process of dying. 
            A star maintains its stability through a fine balance between its own gravity, 
            which holds it together, and the outwards pressure from ongoing thermonuclear fusion processes taking place at its core.</p>
