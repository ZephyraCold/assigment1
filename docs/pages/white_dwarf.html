        <p>
            The vast majority of white dwarfs are formed after a dying star has shed its outer layers to form a planetary nebula, 
            leaving behind an approximately Earth-sized inner core that is the white dwarf. 
            Other white dwarfs in binary systems may explode as novae but then not go on to form a neutron star or a black hole.</p>
